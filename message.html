  <p>Hey...</p>

  <p>This is an apology (another ðŸ˜…) for my behavior yesterday. I know there's no excuse or reason for the way I acted yesterday, But I still owe you this.</p>

  <p>I think because I like you so much, I end up acting immaturely and dumping petty things on you. I know I told you I would wait, but I don't want that to make you owe me anything. It's your choice, and I just have to respect that. I just want you to make it last as long as you can. It doesn't matter if there are things that can't be said, I can accept that. It's your space, and I'll respect it.</p>

  <p>I feel stupid for doing this, it's confusing, this whole situation is new to me, I haven't felt this way before, so I ask you to forgive my actions.</p>

  <p>Can you forgive me?</p>
